## What is the `shallow nesting` 
answer :
    `In Laravel, shallow nesting is a technique used to simplify the URL structure of nested resources within your application's routes. It allows you to define routes for child resources without explicitly including the parent resource's ID in the URL.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Traditional Nested Routes:

By default, Laravel's resource routes expect you to define routes for both parent and child resources.
The URL structure includes the parent resource's ID to uniquely identify the child resource.
Example:

`Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);
Route::resource('posts.comments', CommentController::class);`

This approach would generate URLs like:


/posts/1/comments/2 (to access comment 2 of post 1)
Shallow Nesting:

By adding the shallow method after defining a nested resource, you can omit the parent resource's ID from the URL.
Example:

Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);
Route::resource('posts.comments', CommentController::class)->shallow();
With shallow nesting, the URL becomes:

/posts/comments/2 (directly accessing comment 2, without mentioning post ID)
Benefits of Shallow Nesting:

Cleaner and more concise URLs, improving readability.
Reduces redundancy in URLs, especially for deeply nested resources.
Things to Consider:

Shallow nesting only affects the URL structure, not the underlying functionality. Laravel still uses implicit model binding to identify the parent resource.
If you need access to the parent resource model within your controller methods for the child resource, you might need to fetch it explicitly using the route parameters or relationships.`
