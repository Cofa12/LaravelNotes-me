# All middleware are resolved via the service container,so you may type-hint any dependencies you need within a middleware's constructor.

Middleware: In Laravel, middleware are classes that execute before a request reaches a controller or route. They can be used for various purposes, such as authentication, authorization, logging, request modification, etc.
Dependency Injection: This is a software design pattern that promotes loose coupling by providing dependencies (objects or services) to a class through its constructor or setter methods. In Laravel, the service container acts as the central registry for managing dependencies.
How It Works:

Middleware Definition: You define your middleware class extending the Illuminate\Http\Middleware\BaseMiddleware class.
Dependency Injection: Within the middleware's constructor, you can use type hinting to specify the dependencies your middleware needs. Laravel will automatically resolve these dependencies using the service container.
Resolving Dependencies: When your middleware is registered and a request triggers it, Laravel utilizes the service container to retrieve the required dependencies based on the type hints in the constructor.
